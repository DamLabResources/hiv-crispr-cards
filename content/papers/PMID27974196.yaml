abstract: Current drug therapies effectively suppress HIV-1 replication but do not
    inactivate the provirus that persists in latent reservoirs. Recent studies have
    found that the guide RNA (gRNA)-directed CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used for sequence-specific
    attack on this proviral DNA. Although potent inhibition of virus replication was
    reported, HIV-1 can escape from a single antiviral gRNA by mutation of the target
    sequence. Here, we demonstrate that combinations of two antiviral gRNAs delay
    viral escape, and identify two gRNA combinations that durably block virus replication.
    When viral escape is prevented, repeated Cas9 cleavage leads to saturation of
    major mutations in the conserved target sequences that encode critical proteins.
    This hypermutation coincides with the loss of replication-competent virus as scored
    in sensitive co-cultures with unprotected cells, demonstrating complete virus
    inactivation. These results provide a proof-of-principle that HIV-1-infected cells
    can be functionally cured by dual-gRNA CRISPR/Cas9 treatment.
