Abstract: Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the mammalian brain, perform key
    functions and are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. The human immunodeficiency
    virus (HIV) can persist in astrocytes, contributing to the HIV burden and neurological
    dysfunctions in infected individuals. While a comprehensive approach to HIV cure
    must include the targeting of HIV-1 in astrocytes, dedicated tools for this purpose
    are still lacking. Here we report a novel Adeno-associated virus-based vector
    (AAV9P1) with a synthetic surface peptide for transduction of astrocytes. Analysis
    of AAV9P1 transduction efficiencies with single brain cell populations, including
    primary human brain cells, as well as human brain organoids demonstrated that
    AAV9P1 targeted terminally differentiated human astrocytes much more efficiently
    than neurons. We then investigated whether AAV9P1 can be used to deliver HIV-inhibitory
    genes to astrocytes. To this end we generated AAV9P1 vectors containing genes
    for HIV-1 proviral editing by CRISPR/Cas9. Latently HIV-1 infected astrocytes
    transduced with these vectors showed significantly diminished reactivation of
    proviruses, compared with untransduced cultures. Sequence analysis identified
    mutations/deletions in key HIV-1 transcriptional control regions. We conclude
    that AAV9P1 is a promising tool for gene delivery to astrocytes and may facilitate
    inactivation/destruction of persisting HIV-1 proviruses in astrocyte reservoirs.
