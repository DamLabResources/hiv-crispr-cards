Abstract: Cas9 cleaves specific DNA sequences with the assistance of a programmable
    single guide RNA (sgRNA). Repairing this broken DNA by the cell's error-prone
    non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) machinery leads to insertions and deletions
    (indels) that often impair DNA function. Using HIV-1, we have now demonstrated
    that many of these indels are indeed lethal for the virus, but that others lead
    to the emergence of replication competent viruses that are resistant to Cas9/sgRNA.
    This unexpected contribution of Cas9 to the development of viral resistance is
    facilitated by some indels that are not deleterious for viral replication, but
    that are refractory to recognition by the same sgRNA as a result of changing the
    target DNA sequences. This observation illustrates two opposite outcomes of Cas9/sgRNA
    action, i.e., inactivation of HIV-1 and acceleration of viral escape, thereby
    potentially limiting the use of Cas9/sgRNA in HIV-1 therapy.
