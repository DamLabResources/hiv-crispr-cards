abstract: CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been proposed as a therapeutic treatment
    for HIV-1 infection. CRISPR/Cas9 induced double strand breaks (DSBs) targeted
    to the integrated viral genome have been shown to decrease production of progeny
    virus. Unfortunately HIV-1 evolves rapidly and may readily produce CRISPR/Cas9
    resistant strains. Here we used next-generation sequencing to characterize HIV-1
    strains that developed resistance to six different CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs (gRNAs).
    Reverse transcriptase (RT) derived base substitution mutations were commonly found
    at sites encoding unpaired bases of RNA stem-loop structures. In addition to RT
    mutations, insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations were common. Indels localized
    to the CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage site were major contributors to CRISPR gRNA resistance.
    While most indels at non-coding regions were a single base pair, 3 base pair indels
    were observed when a coding region of HIV-1 was targeted. The DSB repair event
    may preserve the HIV-1 reading frame, while destroying CRISPR gRNA homology. HIV-1
    may be successfully edited by CRISPR/Cas9, but the virus remains competent for
    replication and resistant to further CRISPR/Cas9 targeting at that site. These
    observations strongly suggest that host DSB repair at CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage sites
    is a novel and important pathway that may contribute to HIV-1 therapeutic resistance.
