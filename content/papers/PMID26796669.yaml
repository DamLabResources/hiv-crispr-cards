abstract: 'Several recent studies demonstrated that the clustered regularly interspaced
    short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas9 can be used for
    guide RNA (gRNA)-directed, sequence-specific cleavage of HIV proviral DNA in infected
    cells. We here demonstrate profound inhibition of HIV-1 replication by harnessing
    T cells with Cas9 and antiviral gRNAs. However, the virus rapidly and consistently
    escaped from this inhibition. Sequencing of the HIV-1 escape variants revealed
    nucleotide insertions, deletions, and substitutions around the Cas9/gRNA cleavage
    site that are typical for DNA repair by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway.
    We thus demonstrate the potency of CRISPR-Cas9 as an antiviral approach, but any
    therapeutic strategy should consider the viral escape implications. '
