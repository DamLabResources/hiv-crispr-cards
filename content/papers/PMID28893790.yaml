Abstract: 'Many potent antiviral drugs have been developed against HIV-1, and their
    combined action is usually successful in achieving durable virus suppression in
    infected individuals. This success is based on two effects: additive or even synergistic
    virus inhibition and an increase in the genetic threshold for development of drug
    resistance. More recently, several genetic approaches have been developed to attack
    the HIV-1 genome in a gene therapy setting. We set out to test the combinatorial
    possibilities for a therapy based on the CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference (RNAi)
    mechanisms that attack the viral DNA and RNA, respectively. When two different
    sites in the HIV-1 genome were targeted, either with dual CRISPR-Cas9 antivirals
    or with a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi antivirals, we observed additive
    inhibition, much like what was reported for antiviral drugs. However, when the
    same or overlapping viral sequence was attacked by the antivirals, rapid escape
    from a CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral, assisted by the error-prone nonhomologous end joining
    (NHEJ) DNA repair machinery, accelerated the development of cross-resistance to
    the other CRISPR-Cas9 or RNAi antiviral. Thus, genetic antiviral approaches can
    be combined, but overlap should be avoided.'
