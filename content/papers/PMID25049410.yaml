abstract: 'AIDS remains incurable due to the permanent integration of HIV-1 into the
    host genome, imparting risk of viral reactivation even after antiretroviral therapy.
    New strategies are needed to ablate the viral genome from latently infected cells,
    because current methods are too inefficient and prone to adverse off-target effects.
    To eliminate the integrated HIV-1 genome, we used the Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) system,
    in single and multiplex configurations. We identified highly specific targets
    within the HIV-1 LTR U3 region that were efficiently edited by Cas9/gRNA, inactivating
    viral gene expression and replication in latently infected microglial, promonocytic,
    and T cells. Cas9/gRNAs caused neither genotoxicity nor off-target editing to
    the host cells, and completely excised a 9,709-bp fragment of integrated proviral
    DNA that spanned from its 5'' to 3'' LTRs. Furthermore, the presence of multiplex
    gRNAs within Cas9-expressing cells prevented HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest
    that Cas9/gRNA can be engineered to provide a specific, efficacious prophylactic
    and therapeutic approach against AIDS. '
