Abstract: 'Even though highly active anti-retroviral therapy is able to keep HIV-1
    replication under control, the virus can lie in a dormant state within the host
    genome, known as a latent reservoir, and poses a threat to re-emerge at any time.
    However, novel technologies aimed at disrupting HIV-1 provirus may be capable
    of eradicating viral genomes from infected individuals. In this study, we showed
    the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the HIV-1 genome and block its
    expression. When LTR-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 components were transfected into HIV-1
    LTR expression-dormant and -inducible T cells, a significant loss of LTR-driven
    expression was observed after stimulation. Sequence analysis confirmed that this
    CRISPR/Cas9 system efficiently cleaved and mutated LTR target sites. More importantly,
    this system was also able to remove internal viral genes from the host cell chromosome.
    Our results suggest that the CRISPR/Cas9 system may be a useful tool for curing
    HIV-1 infection. '
