abstract: 'DNA editing using CRISPR/Cas has emerged as a potential treatment for diseases
    caused by pathogenic human DNA viruses. One potential target is HIV-1, which replicates
    via a chromosomally integrated DNA provirus. While CRISPR/Cas can protect T cells
    from de novo HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 frequently becomes resistant due to mutations
    in the chosen single guide RNA (sgRNA) target site. To address this problem, we
    asked whether an sgRNA targeted to a conserved, functionally critical HIV-1 sequence
    might prevent the selection of escape mutants. We report that two sgRNAs specific
    for the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) element produce opposite results:
    the TAR2 sgRNA rapidly selects for mutants that retain TAR function, but are no
    longer inhibited by Cas9, while the TAR1 sgRNA fails to select any replication
    competent TAR mutants, most probably because it is targeted to a region of TAR
    that is disrupted by even minor mutations.'
