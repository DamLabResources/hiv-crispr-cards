Abstract: "The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a novel and promising tool for editing\
    \ the HIV-1 proviral genome. We designed RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the\
    \ HIV-1 regulatory genes tat and rev with guide RNAs (gRNA) selected from each\
    \ gene based on CRISPR specificity and sequence conservation across six major\
    \ HIV-1 subtypes. Each gRNA was cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 before co-transfection\
    \ to create a lentiviral vector and transduction into target cells. CRISPR/Cas9\
    \ transduction into 293\u2009T and HeLa cells stably expressing Tat and Rev proteins\
    \ successfully abolished the expression of each protein relative to that in non-transduced\
    \ and gRNA-absent vector-transduced cells. Tat functional assays showed significantly\
    \ reduced HIV-1 promoter-driven luciferase expression after tat-CRISPR transduction,\
    \ while Rev functional assays revealed abolished gp120 expression after rev-CRISPR\
    \ transduction. The target gene was mutated at the Cas9 cleavage site with high\
    \ frequency and various indel mutations. Conversely, no mutations were detected\
    \ at off-target sites and Cas9 expression had no effect on cell viability. CRISPR/Cas9\
    \ was further tested in persistently and latently HIV-1-infected T-cell lines,\
    \ in which p24 levels were significantly suppressed even after cytokine reactivation,\
    \ and multiplexing all six gRNAs further increased efficiency. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas9\
    \ system targeting HIV-1 regulatory genes may serve as a favorable means to achieve\
    \ functional cures."
