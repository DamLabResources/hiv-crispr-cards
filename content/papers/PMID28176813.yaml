abstract: HIV presents one of the highest evolutionary rates ever detected and combination
    antiretroviral therapy is needed to overcome the plasticity of the virus population
    and control viral replication. Conventional treatments lack the ability to clear
    the latent reservoir, which remains the major obstacle towards a cure. Novel strategies,
    such as CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA-based genome-editing, can permanently disrupt the HIV
    genome. However, HIV genome-editing may accelerate viral escape, questioning the
    feasibility of the approach. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of
    single HIV loci, only partially inhibits HIV replication and facilitates rapid
    viral escape at the target site. A combinatorial approach of two strong gRNAs
    targeting different regions of the HIV genome can completely abrogate viral replication
    and prevent viral escape. Our data shows that the accelerating effect of gene-editing
    on viral escape can be overcome and as such gene-editing may provide a future
    alternative for control of HIV-infection.
