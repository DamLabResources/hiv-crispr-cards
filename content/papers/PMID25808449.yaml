abstract: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed HIV-1 infection
    from a deadly disease to a manageable chronic illness, albeit does not provide
    a cure. The recently developed genome editing system called CRISPR/Cas9 offers
    a new tool to inactivate the integrated latent HIV-1 DNA and may serve as a new
    avenue toward cure.
