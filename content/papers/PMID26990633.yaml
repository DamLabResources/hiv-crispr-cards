Abstract: There is an urgent need for the development of HIV-1 genome eradication
    strategies that lead to a permanent cure for HIV-1/AIDS. We previously reported
    that four guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) effectively
    eradicated the entire HIV-1 genome. In this study, we sought to identify the best
    gRNAs targeting HIV-1 LTR and viral structural region and optimize gRNA pairing
    that can efficiently eradicate the HIV-1 genome.
