abstract: 'To combat hostile viruses, bacteria and archaea have evolved a unique antiviral
    defense system composed of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
    (CRISPRs), together with CRISPR-associated genes (Cas). The CRISPR/Cas9 system
    develops an adaptive immune resistance to foreign plasmids and viruses by creating
    site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Here we adapt the CRISPR/Cas9
    system to human cells for intracellular defense against foreign DNA and viruses.
    Using HIV-1 infection as a model, our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9
    system disrupts latently integrated viral genome and provides long-term adaptive
    defense against new viral infection, expression and replication in human cells.
    We show that engineered human-induced pluripotent stem cells stably expressing
    HIV-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 can be efficiently differentiated into HIV reservoir
    cell types and maintain their resistance to HIV-1 challenge. These results unveil
    the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a new therapeutic strategy against
    viral infections. '
